[Verse 1]
I'm alright if you ask me, but you never do
Is this thing on?
I'm coming to shoot from the side of Dirty Canal
And I never felt better since I let it go
You find out who your friends are when the city's cold
You speak like a child

[Chorus]
And I've been reading the French press
And I've been disconnected

[Verse 2]
People used to say under their breath
That you've got the looks and I've got all of the rest
Didn't work out for the best
But brother, don't you know, brother, don't you know?
That jealousy is a curse, much worse is the silence
Strange, you're moving out of range

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
You keep it alright, that's good to know
The cup runs over, the overflow
But nothing happens here, the time ticks slow
But the money walks and the hot air blows
And the same shirt and the same crack, the same window
Chicken from a French press
Fiona's strange address, did your hear back?
(I'm having trouble making you out)
Did you hear about? (I said, I think I'm cutting out)
Did you? (I'm having trouble)
Did you hear about?
